<h1> Introduction </h1>
My name is Muhammad imran, i usually go by either Muhammad or Moey. This is my first Year at RMIT - i am currently studying Bachelors of Information Technology. Since high school, I have been interested in studying I.T just like many of us i was interested in working on projects and making Programs, which is the main reason why i am at RMIT. I have a little experience with website development and a fair bit knowledge in coding. As mentioned earlier i have made several Apps in C#, which helped  master the language and now i can comfortably program in C#. Overall, my goal is to compelete my degree and start working. 

<h1> Interests in I.T </h1>
i have Studied Software development in highschool, which helped me with coding alot as my main interest in I.T is making programs which run efficiently and effectively. I have worked on different projects, some were group and some were indivdual which mainly involved coding using C#. i have been learning and using it to code for almost 2 and a 1/2 years. So, my main interest in I.T is really simlpe and straight forward, as it is mainly coding or web designing. 

<h2> Ideal Job</h2>
After obtaining my degree in I.T, my aim is to work as a software developer and eventually start my own I.T business. In the business my aim is to hire multiple software developers and create programs demanded by the market at a profitable price. As the business grows it will start hiring internationally and providing as the market demands.

<h2> My Profile </h2>
According to the test Results, my personality is a protagonist. i believe as a part of the team i would try socialise and get to know everyone before initiating a project idea. Based on my personality i am really easy to get along with and work with as i am socially confident and able to control myself when needed to. Usually in a group project if an idea seems legitmate i would not question it otherwise i would look deeper into it to find a meaning or how to resolve it. Atmost, i would think about something being right or wrong but most of the time when i know "or i feel" usually works out.

# Introduction 
My name is Muhammad imran, i usually go by either Muhammad or Moey. This is my first Year at RMIT - i am currently studying Bachelors of Information Technology. Since high school, I have been interested in studying I.T or just like many of us i was interested in working on projects and making Programs, which is the main reason why i am at RMIT. I have a little experience with website development and a fair bit knowledge in coding. As mentioned earlier i have made several Apps in C#, which helped  master the language and now i can comfortably program in C#.
